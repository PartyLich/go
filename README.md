Go libs!

While practicing a bit of Go I found myself rather surprised at the some of the things that are
(intentionally, afaik) absent from the standard libraries. Like a Math.Max function for the default
inferred number type, int. So, like (presumably) countless others before me, I found myself
reinventing these otherwise common wheels.


Setup hooks, if desired
```bash
git config --local core.hooksPath .git-hooks
```
